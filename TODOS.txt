okay so basically:

COMPLETE: when a new alarm is set (or changed), send a notification that the wakelight will be activated 30 minutes before the alarm
COMPLETE: allow user to disable wakelight for this alarm
COMPLETE: allow user to set schedule in which the wakelight should be enabled for alarms and outside it it should at most ask to enable wakelight
COMPLETE: allow user to change the window before the alarm time in which the wakelight will start

allow schedule regex validation

do actual wakelight functionality

WORKING ON IT: and since I already know this is gonna get ugly fast: refactor
