# Wakelight Companion
An Android companion app for my custom wakelight

## TODOS:
// Not necessarily in order

[ ] Make multiple implementations for different kinds of devices
	[x] Yeelight
	[ ] Tuya
	[ ] HomeAssistant?
	[ ] ~Google Home~ Probably not happening since they don't really like third parties sending commands to Google Home in any way
[ ] Store config as serialized Config object, implement serialization and deserialization
[ ] Allow multiple lights to be used
	[ ] Allow multiple configs to be stored and created in the UI
	[ ] Update code to work with list of devices/configs instead of a single one
	
### URL for own reference
Because Tuya made it an absolute PITA to find this: https://eu.iot.tuya.com/cloud/basic

(Note that the server should be central europe, NOT western europe)
